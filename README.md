# Just Make It Already. Pretty Please?

This is a collection of scripts I collect to run GNU Make on Windows. Now,
GNU Make itself actually works [very well] on Windows, but Makefiles out there
generally assume you are using a POSIX shell (or even Bash) when you run it.
They therefore usually contains commands only available on POSIX, even though
they don't need to.

[very well]: (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

One such example is [Warehouse]. It uses a Makefile to start up development
Docker containers. The containers work fine, but the Makefile does not.

Fortunately, those things are generally very easy to work around, since Windows
do have those functionalities, only not by the same command. This is a
collection of scripts I built progressively when I encounter this kind of
problems.

Note: I don't need to stub Python commands (e.g. `python3.6`) because that's
already covered by [PythonUp]. You should use it too.

## Commands

These are simple BAT files in `cmd`, generally one-liners mapping a trivial
functionality to Windows.

* `#.bat`: Make comments work. Basically a no-op, but bridges whatever return
  code was returned by the previous command forward (mimicking POSIX shell
  behaviour).
* `touch.bat`: "Touch" a file, creating it if needed. On Windows this can be
  done by writing `NUL` (nothing) to the end of a file.
* `which.bat`: Uses [bat] to only return the first entry of `where`, unless
  `-a` is passed.
* `head.bat` : Uses [bat]. `-n` is supported.
* `less.bat`: Uses [bat]. `-n` is supported.

Flags are restrictive due to the severe restrictions imposed by BAT. They must
come first, and have a tendency to blow up if passed the wrong things. I can
live with it though since this is mainly used for pre-written scripts that
should work anyway, and donâ€™t really need good error messages.


## TODO

* `mkdir`. Need to at least support `-p`. Not sure if a BAT is enough.
* `rm`. Need to at least support `r` and `f` flags, as commonly needed. Can't
  do this simply with BAT, so Rust it is.
